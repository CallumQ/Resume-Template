# Resume-Template

## About
This repository contains the LaTeX file that I use for my Resume (CV in UK-land). It is primarily designed to be a single-page, but should work just as well with multiple pages.

This repository was created on Fedora 40 & Podman was used for launching the dev-container. It should work for other distros but I haven't tested this.

## Why LaTeX?
It may seem a bit overkill, but once you have your template working with LaTeX it tends to be much easier to maintain versus something written in Microsoft Word, Especially when it comes to positioning text and/or elements which may not follow the normal flow.

## How to use
Edit the placeholder content in `resume.tex`. Upon saving the file, the pdf will be automatically regenerated.

If you want to add any additional dependencies, they can be added in the `DEPENDS.txt` file.

## Example
An example output CV can be found [here](Example/Example_Resume.pdf).
